            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>A macchiato is a coffee beverage that consists of a shot of espresso "stained" or "marked" with a small
                amount of frothed milk. The term "macchiato" is Italian for "stained" or "spotted," indicating the brief
                addition of milk to the espresso. This results in a coffee with a strong and bold flavor, complemented
                by a touch of creaminess from the frothed milk. <br><br> There are variations of the macchiato, with one
                popular version being the "caramel macchiato," where caramel syrup is often added for sweetness. The
                traditional macchiato, however, emphasizes the pure and robust taste of the espresso with just a hint of
                milk. <br><br> Macchiatos are often served in smaller cups, and their simplicity highlights the quality
                of the coffee. The balance between the intensity of the espresso and the light touch of milk makes the
                macchiato a favorite for those who enjoy a strong coffee experience with a subtle creaminess.
