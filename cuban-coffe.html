            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>Cuban coffee, also known as "cafecito" or "Cuban espresso," is a strong and sweet coffee preparation that
                is popular in Cuba and among coffee enthusiasts worldwide. It is typically made using a stovetop
                espresso maker called a "cafetera" or an espresso machine. <br><br> The key element of Cuban coffee is
                the addition of sugar to the coffee grounds during the brewing process, resulting in a sweet and
                concentrated espresso. The coffee is often served in small cups known as "demitasse" cups. A classic
                variation is the "Caf√© Cubano," where a shot of espresso is sweetened
                with sugar that has been whipped to a creamy consistency, creating a layer of frothy sweetness on top of
                the coffee. <br><br> Cuban coffee is deeply ingrained in Cuban culture, often enjoyed as a social ritual
                and a pick-me-up throughout the day. It reflects the influence of Spanish and Latin American coffee
                traditions while incorporating a distinct Cuban flair.
