            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>A cappuccino is a popular espresso-based coffee beverage that originated in Italy. It is composed of
                equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and frothed milk. The name "cappuccino" is derived from the Capuchin
                friars, whose brown robes are said to resemble the color of the drink. <br><br> To prepare a cappuccino,
                a shot of espresso is first brewed. Then, equal parts of steamed milk and frothed milk are added,
                creating a layered and textured drink. The frothed milk contributes to the creamy and velvety texture of
                the cappuccino. <br><br> Cappuccinos are known for their balanced and rich flavor profile, combining the
                intensity of espresso with the smoothness of milk. The traditional serving size is around 6 ounces, but
                variations in size and proportions exist based on personal preferences and regional customs.
                Additionally, cappuccinos are often enjoyed with a dusting of cocoa or cinnamon on top for added flavor.
