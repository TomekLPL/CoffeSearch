            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>A flat white is a coffee beverage that originated in Australia or New Zealand and has gained popularity
                worldwide. It is made by pouring microfoam (steamed milk with fine, velvety bubbles) over a shot of
                espresso. The key feature of a flat white is the balance between the rich intensity of espresso and the
                creamy texture of the microfoam. <br><br> Unlike a latte, which has more steamed milk and a thin layer
                of foam, or a cappuccino, which has equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam, a flat white has a
                higher coffee-to-milk ratio and a thin layer of microfoam. This results in a strong and smooth coffee
                with a velvety mouthfeel. <br><br> The flat white has become a popular choice in many coffee shops,
                known for its simple yet sophisticated composition that highlights the quality of the espresso. It is
                often served in a smaller cup than a latte, making it a favorite for those who enjoy a strong coffee
                flavor with a touch of creamy texture.
