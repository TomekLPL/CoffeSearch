            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>Iced coffee is a cold coffee beverage that is served over ice. It is made by brewing hot coffee and then
                cooling it down, either by pouring it over ice or refrigerating it. Iced coffee can be sweetened and
                flavored according to personal preferences, and it is often served with milk or cream. <br><br> There
                are various methods for making iced coffee, including brewing it hot and then chilling it or using
                cold brew techniques where coffee grounds are steeped in cold water for an extended period. Iced coffee
                is a popular and refreshing option, especially in warmer weather, offering a chilled and customizable
                alternative to traditional hot coffee.
