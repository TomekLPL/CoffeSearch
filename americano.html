            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p> An Americano is a popular coffee beverage made by diluting a shot of espresso with hot water. This
                results in a coffee that has a flavor profile similar to drip coffee but with a strength more comparable
                to espresso. <br><br>The drink is believed to have originated during World War II when American soldiers
                in
                Italy diluted espresso to suit their taste preferences. The Americano is characterized by its simplicity
                and is often served black, although some people may add sugar or milk according to their preferences.
                <br><br>
                It's a versatile and widely enjoyed coffee option that provides a milder and larger cup compared to a
                straight espresso.
