            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>Nitro cold brew coffee is a trendy and innovative variation of cold brew coffee that is infused with
                nitrogen gas, typically served on tap, similar to a draft beer. The addition of nitrogen creates a
                smooth and creamy texture, enhancing the overall drinking experience. The nitrogen infusion results in a
                cascade of tiny bubbles, giving the coffee a velvety mouthfeel and a visually appealing, frothy head.
                <br><br> To make nitro cold brew, cold brew coffee is first brewed by steeping coarsely ground coffee in
                cold water for an extended period. Afterward, it is kegged or canned, and nitrogen is added under high
                pressure. When poured from a tap or opened from a can, the nitrogen is released, creating the signature
                creamy texture and effervescence. <br><br> Nitro cold brew is appreciated for its bold coffee flavor,
                low acidity, and the unique sensory experience provided by the nitrogen infusion. It has gained
                popularity in coffee shops and has become a sought-after alternative for those who enjoy cold coffee
                beverages with a twist.
