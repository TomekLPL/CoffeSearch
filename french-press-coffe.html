            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there wasn't a widely recognized or standardized
                preparation known as "nitro French press coffee." However, the coffee industry is dynamic and
                continually evolving, and new methods and trends emerge.<br><br>A traditional French press involves
                steeping coarsely ground coffee in hot water and then separating the grounds by pressing a plunger
                through a mesh filter. If there have been developments since my last update, a "nitro French press"
                could potentially refer to a variation where nitrogen is infused into coffee brewed using a French
                press. This could impart a creamy texture and effervescence similar to nitro-infused beverages.</p>
