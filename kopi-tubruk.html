            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>Originating from Italy, espresso is a concentrated coffee brewed by forcing hot water under pressure
                through finely-ground coffee beans. <br><br>Its name, meaning "pressed out" or "on demand," reflects the
                quick preparation method. Espresso is known for its rich and intense flavor, achieved through a short
                brewing time, typically around 25-30 seconds. <br><br>The hallmark golden crema on top adds a layer of
                complexity, and its serving size of about 30 ml makes it a potent and beloved shot in the world of
                coffee. <br><br>Whether enjoyed on its own or as a base for various coffee creations, espresso stands as
                a testament to the art and science of coffee brewing.</p>
