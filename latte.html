            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>A latte is a popular coffee beverage that consists of a shot of espresso mixed with steamed milk and
                topped with a small layer of frothed milk. The word "latte" comes from the Italian caff√® latte, which
                means "milk coffee." Lattes are known for their smooth and creamy texture, and they provide a balanced
                combination of the bold flavor of espresso and the richness of milk. <br><br> The standard ratio for a
                latte is one-third espresso to two-thirds steamed milk, with a thin layer of froth on top. Lattes can be
                customized by adding flavor syrups, such as vanilla or caramel, based on personal preferences. The
                versatility of lattes has contributed to their popularity, and they are commonly served in various
                sizes, ranging from small to large, in coffee shops around the world.</p>
