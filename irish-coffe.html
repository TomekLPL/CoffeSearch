            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>Irish coffee is a popular and classic cocktail that combines hot coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar, and a
                layer of cream on top. It is typically served in a warmed glass to enhance the drinking experience. The
                whiskey provides a robust flavor, and the cream floats on the surface, creating a visually appealing and
                delicious contrast to the hot coffee. <br><br> The traditional recipe involves pouring hot coffee into a
                pre-warmed glass, adding a measure of Irish whiskey and sugar, and then gently floating a layer of
                whipped cream on top. The cream is not stirred into the coffee, allowing for a distinctive presentation
                and a gradual blending of flavors as it's consumed. <br><br> Irish coffee is often enjoyed as a warming
                and comforting beverage, and it has become associated with hospitality and relaxation. It's a popular
                choice in colder climates and is sometimes served after a meal or as a festive drink on occasions like
                St. Patrick's Day.</p>
