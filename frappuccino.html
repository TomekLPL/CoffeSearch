            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>A Frappuccino is a trademarked blended coffee beverage popularized by Starbucks. It typically consists of
                coffee or a coffee-flavored base, ice, and milk, all blended together to create a smooth and frothy
                drink. The mixture is often flavored with syrups, and whipped cream is commonly added on top for extra
                indulgence.<br><br>Frappuccinos come in various flavors, ranging from classic coffee to fruit-based or
                dessert-inspired options. Some popular variations include the Mocha Frappuccino, Caramel Frappuccino,
                and Java Chip Frappuccino. Non-coffee versions, such as the Vanilla Bean Frappuccino, are also
                available.<br><br> Frappuccinos are known for their refreshing and creamy texture, making them a popular
                choice, especially during warmer months. The customizable nature of the drink allows individuals to
                tailor their Frappuccino to their taste preferences by adjusting the type of milk, syrups, and
                additional toppings.</p>
