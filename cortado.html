            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>A cortado is a coffee beverage that originated in Spain and is characterized by a simple and balanced
                combination of equal parts espresso and warm milk. The word "cortado" translates to "cut" in Spanish,
                referring to the practice of "cutting" the espresso with a small amount of steamed milk.
                <br><br> Typically served in a small glass, a cortado maintains the strong and robust flavor of espresso
                while reducing its intensity by incorporating the smoothness of steamed milk. The result is a drink that
                strikes a balance between the boldness of espresso and the creaminess of milk, making it a popular
                choice for those who enjoy a well-rounded coffee experience without the heaviness of a larger milk-based
                drink. <br><br> Cortados are often served without additional flavorings or sweeteners, allowing the
                natural flavors of the coffee to shine through. The precise ratios of espresso to milk can vary, but the
                essence of a cortado lies in its harmonious blend of these two key components.
