            <h2>About this exquisite coffee:</h2>
            <p>Cold brew coffee is a refreshing and smooth coffee beverage made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans
                in cold or room temperature water for an extended period, usually 12 to 24 hours. The slow extraction
                process produces a concentrated coffee concentrate that is later diluted with water or milk before
                serving. <br><br> Unlike traditional hot-brewed coffee, cold brew is known for its lower acidity and
                milder, less bitter flavor profile. It often has subtle, nuanced undertones, making it a popular choice
                for those who enjoy
                a smoother and less intense coffee experience. <br><br> Cold brew can be served over ice and is often
                customizable with sweeteners, flavored syrups, or cream, depending on individual taste preferences. Its
                popularity has grown in recent years, and it is commonly
                found in coffee shops and easily prepared at home using various brewing devices designed specifically
                for cold brewing.
